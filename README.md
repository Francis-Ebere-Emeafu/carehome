There is a Daily Record module
This Daily record module is  to use to record the activities of the young person
This Daily record includes
  Daily Notes
  Feeding entries
  Medication entries
  Family visit entries
  Behaviour entries
So each young person has a daily record

The important function on the daily recorded is as follows
  1. You can only have one note for a day, so if the note already exit , you cannot  add another note  for the same day you can only edit it

So the next day should be a complete blank page without any record.  And so on .


Only the manager can see and edit past Records. We will talk about the manager dashboard later
